# How I Crawl My Way Into Getting A Place To Rent In Dublin Via Daft.ie
#### It’s actually easier than you think


For those who aren’t familiar with [daft.ie](http://daft.ie), it contains 80% of all available property in Ireland. Daft.ie was the only medium I used to secure my accommodation when I initially moved to Dublin.

#### Great, but why are you making an article on how to use a property site?

During my move to Dublin, I arrived two weeks prior to the first day of my work at Amazon. At the time, I thought the timeline would be sufficient to get a place to live by the time I start work. Without a sense of worry, I began my search on daft 1 day after I settled down in my new temporary Airbnb home.

After 3 days of searching and contacting listings every day for a few hours, I began to get worried because I felt like I wasn’t going to get a place after all; because I had received next to no reply after all the work. This may sound strange but the truth is that there are fewer places available in the market compared to the demand.

The turning point came when I reached out to a friend who had just got a place a week before me. He suggested to automate the process and that had changed my approach completely. As a software engineer, this was a good opportunity to put my skills into work. In the end, I utilized a script that would capture any listing on daft and automatically contact the landlord for me. The automation resulted in my email to the landlord being placed on the top of the pile. As a result, I found a place to live in just a couple of days before my employment.

During the process, I learn that:

- Having money for the property doesn’t mean you will get it

- Many people are competing for the same property

- Landlords will require you to view the place

- Automation wins at the end of the day

Finding a property on daft was time-consuming and extremely unrewarding to be browsing through the list of listings and applying to the listings. Recently, I expanded my project of the search script by turning it into a website that anyone can use so that they wouldn’t have to go through the same gruesome experience I had in the beginning.

# The easier way to get a property on Daft.ie

Each listing receives 10s of applicants within minutes of the new listing, it’s extremely competitive like applying for a job. However, the most **painless** way would be to utilize [dafthelper](https://dafthelper.ie), a service I built which automatically applies for any existing and new listings for you 24/7.

#### Traditional approach to searching on Daft.ie

- Search property

- Message the landlord by filling in a webform

- Book appointment for viewing

This approach doesn’t always work and didn’t work for me because landlords receive thousands of message and if your messages are late, chances are they won’t see it. This also means time and energy wasted to apply for listings that wouldn’t reply to your interest

#### Using [dafthelper](http://dafthelper.ie) approach to searching on Daft.ie

- Fill in your search criteria and information and let the service do the work

- Book appointment with any landlord that responds to you

This approach is much more painless and takes the pain out of searching without a guaranteed reply to your effort. So you can spend time exploring the city whilst searching for a place. The fact that the service messages the listing immediately allows for you to have a bigger chance of securing the listing you like.
