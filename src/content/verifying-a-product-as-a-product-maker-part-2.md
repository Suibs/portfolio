# [Verifying A Product As A Product Maker (Part 2)](https://medium.com/p/18537e6c5f90?source=post_stats_page---------------------------)

#### It’s going to be a long long journey, enjoy it whilst you’re here

In part 1, we were able to complete the first step of stage 1 (verify the idea). As I’m writing this, I want to learn from Harry Dry, the maker of [marketing example](http://marketingexamples.com). I was inspired by his post [How I got 2,000 new subscribers from Product Hunt](https://marketingexamples.com/conversion/product-hunt) and will spend some time to study the ins and outs behind the success of his last launch.

---

# What was the outcome of his Product Hunt launch?

Put aside the 2,000 new subscribers on his email list, what made his launch worth mentioning?

Harry received 1,500 upvotes and product of the week on [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com), which is an outstanding achievement for a maker. Being put as the product of the week meant a lot of traffic to the site which equates possible interests. Moreover, the massive gain in subscriber count would have meant idea validation and traction for the product.

# What can we learn from his launch?

**Step 1: Pre-launch**

Harry decided that he wasn’t going to launch his product for quick gratification and made it his mission to put his v1.0 of his newly gone live product to test. His goal was to gain 1,000, which was achieved 70 days later.

---

**Step 2: Goal**

His desired outcome from the launch was gaining more email subscribers to his site. To make that happen, he made sure his site was in the best shape possible prior to the launch. A simple modification was done which was the addition of a banner to create the hype factor for visitors.

**Step 3: Subscribers rally in support for his launch**

Within the rules of Product Hunt, Harry notifies his subscribers of the launch, which was enough to put the launch at a very sweet spot — 3rd place on the ranking for the product of the day.

---

**Step 4: Maximal exposure**

To draw the most attention possible to the Product Hunt launch, Harry did the following:

- Tweet from both personal and website account

- Posted on [Startup School forum](https://www.startupschool.org/posts/26717)

- Added a milestone to his [Indie Hacker](https://www.indiehackers.com/) page

- Telegram and Slack groups

The biggest lesson learnt is to build an online presence and contribute to communities along your journey because you couldn’t rely on someone to have your back when you didn’t have theirs.

#### Takeaways from the study

Focus on the audience, speak to them and find out more about the space. Make a conscious effort towards collaborating with others on this journey.

# Where now?

Based on what I had learnt from the article, I released I need to re-evaluate the direction at which this project is going.

**Questions**

Who is my target audience?

Where can I find my audience?

Can they help me to evaluate my project, if so how?

What is the purpose of this project?

**Directions**

One of the most important points I learnt from “[Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296)” by Peter Thiel was the idea of niche targeting. Narrowing down your audience to the specifics will help you to understand their problem and whether your solution is THE solution for them. At the end of the day, if your solution isn’t well defined, it doesn’t provide any value to anybody, which is why ultimately so many projects fail.

Due to my lack of understanding of the market, I’ve decided to take a step back and reposition myself by having a look at what’s available on the market. Something that should’ve been done way before I did anything. Another equally important task is to answer the questions I asked myself above.

# Research

A recommendation was given to check out [99designs](https://en.99designs.pt/), after my brief exchange of the idea of a contest based freelancer platform.

---

#### What is 99designs?

99designs is a freelancer platform for designers mainly, that offers both contest-based and 1-on-1 jobs. As a client on the site, there are plenty of options such that you receive the best bang for your bucks. For this, we’re mostly interested in the contest side.

---

**What are the contest-based options for clients?**

Let’s take the example of web-design for instance.

Bronze, 549€ — 15 concepts

Silver, 819€ — 25 concepts

Gold, 1,499€ — 35 concepts(Mid & low-level designers)

Platinum, 2,299€ — 25 concepts (Top designers, Dedicated manager, Priority support)

**How do contests work?**

1. Describer the design

1. Get many submissions

1. Pick the favourite

---

#### Opinions from first sight

99designs is stylish, well-designed and stunning as you’d expect a platform for designers to be. The range of products covered by the site is conclusive. Overall, the site seems like a solid pick for anyone looking to carry out contest style freelance works in the space. Some attractive features such as NDA protection, money back protection.

---

#### Looking at the internet for some opinions

![Photo by [ian dooley](https://unsplash.com/@sadswim?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/10994/0*wWlQThgiyq6Ddg-L)

Summary of 99designs from a [medium post](https://medium.com/@TECH387/99designs-vs-upwork-for-designers-36974fe441cf) that compares the difference of 99designs and [Upwork](http://upwork.com).

> “99designs has plenty of contests to enter, a perfect place for a beginner looking to build their portfolio; however, it’s hard to win a contest”

An honest review from [ddiy](https://ddiy.co/review-of-99-designs/).

Pros:

- Estimated expected number of submissions based on the budget

- Run a blind contest, where nobody sees the submission but you

Cons:

- Minimals for each category

- Can’t choose your designers

---

# Where to go from here?

It’s clear that although 99designs seems to have the space of contest-based freelancing marketplace mapped out; the platform is by no means perfect. My intention is to find a space in the market and optimise to solve the needs of those in the gap.

---

It’s a good time to answer some of our previous questions, or at least attempt to.

**Who is my target audience?**

Is there an audience that I’m familiar with?

Graduate Software engineers.

**Where can I find my audience?**

Forums for freelancers, maybe?

**Can they help me to evaluate my project, if so how?**

Not sure

**What is the purpose of this project?**

A birthing place for new software engineers to build their portfolio with real projects and a breeding ground for improving the quality of work delivered by professionals.

Maybe it’s ll be good to stick with one purpose at a time?

Can it be just a place for software engineers to build their portfolio whilst being paid for doing good works?

---

That’s part 2 for today, the takeaway for today would be to address the questions properly whilst away and for next time. Stay tuned for part 3!
