# Divergence (Part Three Of Product Making)

#### Making changes can be difficult but is a necessity for moving forward

Over the past few days, I had gone off the path of working on producing a product because I needed some time to evaluate my approach. What I have on my plate right now are [projectspace](http://projectspace.me) and sellmyname.

Projectspace— A contest-based freelancing marketplace. As someone who has never had the experiences of freelancing, I struggled to come up with the solution to accommodate the audience adequately. Having spoken to some freelancers in the area, I understood the market better and plan on continuing my research as a number 2 to-do item on the list by looking at every website from this [recommendation](https://freelance-platforms.financesonline.com/).

Sellmyname — A marketplace that sells unconventional items/services, granted they’re legal. This idea was inspired by Jason Zook, the man who made millions in wearing T-Shirts and selling his last names twice. Selling your name sounds like a silly thing to do and probably not worth much unless you’re famous. The value lies within the oldest idea of the book — supply and demand. The idea of letting people be creative about what they want as long as somebody else is out there for it seemed like a sensible platform to create for the name: sellmyname. Because not everybody wants to sell their name and neither do everybody want to buy someone else’s name.

# Plans

Projectspace is very much in scope, however, I want to take the time to explore sellmyname. The reasons for that are: experiences for creating a platform-based project; shorter requirements meaning creation can take place and finish within the next 2 weeks; a funny idea to pursue. Exactly the ingredients I need to prepare for projectspace, a project I very much like to see succeeding. Having the experience of launching sellmyname will also very much put me in a good spot of being prepared for the projects ahead.

The crossroad that lies within this project would be whether to create a MVP or go with the traditional route of introducing the idea and gather interest. Chances are this project will take a while to grain traction presumably and verifying interest wouldn’t do too much good here. So the question here is: is it worth the time into creating the MVP and if not, what alternatives are there?

The answer is simple. It’s the essence of this journey, go and build it. It’s the only way to find out.

# What happens next?

Having not built a project from scratch for some time now, the thought of creating a product from the ground up scares me, which is the reason why it needs to happen. I have some dev learning to do and it’s definitely exciting to finally chart myself in a spot of growth as a developer. In 2020, there are plenty of tech stacks available to choose from. My approach to development had always been to do what works and build as fast as possible. I’m taking a turn here to properly develop a product I’m proud of even if it means taking a longer timeline.
