# Who is Patrick Collison?

#### The mind behind the uprising fintech company — Stripe

CEO, and co-founder of [Stripe](http://stripe.com), a multi-billion-dollar online company that allows individuals and businesses to send and receive payment over the internet. Patrick grew up in rural Ireland and got his first computer with his communion money; he created his own operating system whilst over a dial-up line.

During an introduction, [Chris Sacca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sacca) describes, an adept investor: Patrick is

- Smart such that he’d be in a league with the likes of people such as [Larry Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page), one of the co-founders of Google

- well-read, and has fantastic photographic-like memory for he just read

- has provocative thoughts and his success was no accident

# What makes Patrick Collison Patrick Collison?

One way to understand who someone is is by listening to how they carry themselves and the content of their speech. The following chapter is a condensed version of the major takeaways I’ve taken from the [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/) [podcast](https://tim.blog/2018/12/24/the-tim-ferriss-show-patrick-collison/).

#### Explore

Throughout his life, Patrick had a fair amount of trying out different things and his parents were supportive of his ventures, which includes taking school off for a year at the age of 15 to pursue a full year of programming. For most parents that would seem a disastrous plan, but these were the things that made Patrick who he is today. There was a period where Patrick dropped out of college, moved to Vancouver; started a company; sold his company and went back to university to study maths and physics. This all happened in the span of two years which seemed unpromising and unstable but it was then that Stripe was born.

#### Reading

Patrick has a long list of recommendations for books (check out his book recommendation [here](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf)). He recommends to ignore recent books and go for the real gems which are older books that had been filtered by people over the years. Patrick’s approach to books was similar to his adventurous side which is to continue finding and reading books in different areas and simultaneously; start one book today and maybe another one on the same day. There’s no particular order of which book should be read or rules to finish one book at a time.

#### Mentality

In the journey of Patrick’s entrepreneurship, his relationship with psychological hardships was an endless battle as he had days of doubts from over-extrapolating from limited data as he puts it. An example of this is:

> Yeah, sorry. The core Stripe payments engine broke. And so our customers just couldn’t get paid and couldn’t accept payments from their customers. And we didn’t have many customers back then. Maybe there were 100 or something. But that was still 100 businesses. It felt like a huge deal. And we fixed it. — From the Tim Ferris Podcast

The hardship also involved keeping an optimism consistently because it was an important attribute when building a future where uncertainties lie. His approach through the tough times was to have gratitude in life as we live in the best time in human history truly.

#### Decision making

Patrick glossed over many different ways of decision making. He stresses to expand world-view by taking a non-emotive approach when faced with someone with a different perspective to life than you and really understand how others see life would provide you more value than one can expect. Having different people to go with different issues can be useful. One of the most interesting concepts was the idea of deciding using to picture how someone you know would do in the same situation. Practice making decisions that way and averaging the responses over time to understand the viability of that particular mode of being in different situations.
