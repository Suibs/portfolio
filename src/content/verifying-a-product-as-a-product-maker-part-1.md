# Verifying A Product As A Product Maker (Part 1)

#### Document the journey and share the lesson along the way

In a world where a bad execution triumphs the best idea on any given day, a fact for most people it’s easier said than done, myself included. For 2020, I want to put my foot down and properly study the process of product creation whilst documenting the process along the way.

# My understanding of product launching thus far

Having launched [dafthelper](http://dafthelper) earlier this year, a service that helps users to find and contact property listing easily; I had the thrill of seeing a high number of visitors concurrently on the site and learned the valuable experience of creating an MVP.

Creating a product involves:

- Verify your ideas

- Create your product

- Launch and gather feedbacks

- Iterate (improve your product) and work on organic growth

Obviously, that was a brief overview of the process merely. There are many ways and steps to take along the way. The book that details each step very well would be “MAKE” by Pieter Levels.

# Current work

As a creator, it’s extremely unrewarding to be sitting around on the computer, searching for the next project to work on. The biggest reason being: there is an abundant number of terrible projects out there and the last thing you’d want is for your new project to join the pile. Ideally, it’ll be perfect to work on a project and provide value because there’s a demand for it. Introducing “projectspace”, a freelancing platform where you bid for the job with the completed work.

This platform will enable

- the best work to be produced

- a place to practice your craft

- the highest quality for your money

# Step 1: Validate your Idea

The best way to do this is to create a landing page that summarises the idea well and to test for interest.

At this stage, my go-to is to find a bootstrap template and modify it until it fits your needs.

Googling “landing page bootstrap template” does the job here

I laid my sight on the “[Quick](https://themehunt.com/item/1527640-quick-website-ui-kit-free)” theme from [thehunt](https://themehunt.com/) and decided that it was the one.

With the template downloaded and ready to go, I got to work.

**1.Logo**

My newest favourite place for this part of the project is actually the logo maker from [namecheap](http://namecheap.com), as they provide decent logo generation with good user experience.

**2. Customising the template**

The approach here is to adjust the template such that it looks like the actual site with no real content or functionality. The reason for that is at this stage, the point of your website is to gather interest. After a couple of hours, this was the result.

**3. Interface for collecting interests**

This is one of the most important part of the stage. For this step, I’ve opted to create a web page with a web form that allows a visitor to enter their email. The reasons being

- Collecting interest via email means you have the means to make contact when the product is ready

- The number of emails collected can be a metric to measure whether this is a viable project to pursue

To do this, I once again utilise the login webpage that came with the template.
